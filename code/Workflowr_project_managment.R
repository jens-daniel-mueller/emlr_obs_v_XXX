wflow_build()
wflow_status()
wflow_publish(c("analysis/index.Rmd"),
              "Publish the initial files for myproject")

# Lastly, now that your code is on GitHub, you need to tell GitHub that you want
# the files in docs/ to be published as a website.
# Go to Settings -> GitHub Pages and choose "master branch docs/ folder" as the Source (instructions).



# Add a new analysis file -------------------------------------------------

# change: date:  "`r format(Sys.time(), '%d %B, %Y')`"

# include link to new html file in _site.yml

# Finally, rebuild, push and push again from R-Studio remaining files not taken care of by workflowr
